// introduction to trees
// they are naturally hierarchical: a collection of entities called nodes linked together to simulate an hierarchy
// we can only travel from node A to B in one direction: that's what hierarchy means after all
// trees are a recursive data structure, the definition of one root with n childs defines a sub-tree which also contains a type of root
// N nodes has n-1 edges 
// Depth of x = length of the path from root to x, the lenght is calculated in edges basically
// Height of x = x being the root of a tree or tree, its the longest path to a leaf (the furthermost leaf), being that a leaf will have 0 height
// the height from the root of the tree to the last leaf is the total height of the tree
// the most common tree is the tree that any node can have 3 children max, also called the BINARY TREE
